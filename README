# 3D printable parametric heat-set insert press

This press is inspired by the one from Adafruit.
It holds a soldering iron on one side, and a metal bar on the other side.
The metal bar is used to flatten the melted plastic that pushes up when the insert is placed.

All of the hardware and dimensions are configurable in the code, so you can use whatever bolts you've got on hand.
I used a mix of m3 and m4 hardware, and some wood screws I got at a local hardware store.
